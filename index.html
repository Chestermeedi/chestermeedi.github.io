  <p>About Me</p>
  </h2>
  
  <p>Honest, Loyal and Hardworking.  I am very good at thinking clearly in stressful situations and do so with lots of patience,
      commitment and persistance.  when i set my mind to something i like to see it through and accomplished.  Raised with a Trial
      and Error mentality to continue something until it's completed perfectly and then completed perfectly again and again.  A 
      dedicated team player to find the common goal and execute it with as few errors as possible</p>
